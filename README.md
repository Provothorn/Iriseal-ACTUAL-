# IrisSeal

IrisSeal is a biometric authentication system that uses iris recognition to securely authenticate users and enable them to digitally sign documents. It captures iris images, extracts biometrics, and stores them as a hash on a blockchain for enhanced security. With IrisSeal, users can request signatures from others by scanning their iris for authentication.

**Features:**
- Iris Recognition: Accurately identifies users based on their unique iris patterns.
- Biometric Storage: Securely stores iris biometrics as a hash on a blockchain.
- Digital Document Signing: Allows users to sign documents digitally after iris authentication.
- Enhanced Security: Utilizes iris recognition and blockchain technology for robust security.
- User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive interface for easy navigation.

**How It Works:**
1. Iris Image Capture: High-resolution images of the iris are captured using a specialized device.
2. Biometric Extraction: Unique biometric features are extracted from the iris image and converted into a hash.
3. Blockchain Storage: The biometric hash is securely stored on a blockchain for tamper-proof authentication.
4. Document Signing: Users can request signatures by scanning the iris of the signer for authentication.
5. Authentication and Verification: IrisSeal compares newly scanned irises with stored biometric hashes for authentication and validation.

**System Requirements:**
- Specialized iris scanning device or camera.
- Internet connectivity for blockchain integration.
- Adequate processing power and storage capacity.

**Security Considerations:**
- Secure and encrypted communication channels are used for data transmission.
- The blockchain ensures tamper-proof storage and data integrity.
- Regular security audits and updates are recommended.

**Limitations:**
- Accuracy may be affected by image quality or certain eye conditions.
- Users with eye injuries or impairments may face difficulties.

IrisSeal provides a secure and reliable biometric authentication system that combines iris recognition, blockchain technology, and digital document signing. It ensures data integrity, protects against identity fraud, and offers an intuitive user experience.
